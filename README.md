# FaceAlignment_Multi-task
## trying to reproduce the result of TCDCN, but failed. 

1.I think the model is just converge at a local optimal, train--15e-4 and val--45e-4. 

2.the results are poor when come to images cropped by myself(out of test set), it may get better result if crop faces use the method as training set,  but i did not have a try

3. some hyperparameters are hard to choose~~~ may be this is the reason of failure~~~


## there are some tricks get verified in this experiment...
